# TwitchTV Stream

The project shows which users are online and which are offline.

_This project shows an example use of Twitch's API. Unfortunately, due to Twitch's condition of API usage, it now requires an API key. Instead, it uses a mock API that provides outdated information but with the same data structure as the original._

The workaround API can only do so much, that I am limited to only making the UserList component.
I have written this project in React and for the visuals, I started uses SCSS, which makes styling easier to read.
